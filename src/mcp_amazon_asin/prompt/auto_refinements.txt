Searching for 'coffee maker' on amazon and getting a list of refinements, in refinements.txt, and  a list of products in theme.txt, and a list of products with title and if it is sponsored ads. For all the sponsored ads, which are ASINs, could you research the product features in theme.txt and titles in search.txt and tell me what are the important refinement category does not mention in refinements.txt but are important for shopper. For the most useful top 3 refinements you found, give me a short title (less than 8 words) to describe them as well as the refinements available under and break down the category. For each refinement, list the ads that matches it.
